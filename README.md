> A free, read-only [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server for **pump.fun** and **Solana**. It gives Claude — or any MCP client — live token discovery, on-chain bonding-curve and holder analysis, creator fee-claim tracking, Solana Name Service resolution, KOL signals, read-only swap quotes, and shareable live 3D token snapshots. Every Solana RPC and pump.fun API call runs server-side on the canonical [three.ws](https://three.ws) backend, so the data is live and on-chain while the client stays zero-config: **no API keys, no RPC URL, no wallet.**

## Install

### Claude Code (one-liner)

```bash
claude mcp add pumpfun -- npx -y @three-ws/pumpfun-mcp
```

### Claude Desktop / Cursor / any MCP client

Add to your MCP config (`claude_desktop_config.json`, `.cursor/mcp.json`, `.mcp.json`, etc.):

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"pumpfun": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["-y", "@three-ws/pumpfun-mcp"]
		}
	}
}
```

Restart the client and the pump.fun tools appear. No install step required.

### Run directly

```bash
npx -y @three-ws/pumpfun-mcp
# or install globally and run the bin
npm i -g @three-ws/pumpfun-mcp && pumpfun-mcp
```

## Quick start

The server speaks stdio JSON-RPC — your MCP client spawns it via the `npx` command above. Once configured, ask your client natural-language questions and it picks the right tool:

```text
"What's trending on pump.fun right now?"        → get_trending_tokens
"Show the bonding curve for <mint>"             → get_bonding_curve
"Who are the top holders of <mint>?"            → get_token_holders
"Resolve bonfida.sol"                           → sns_resolve
"Build a 3D snapshot for <mint>"                → pumpfun_token_3d
```

## Tools

All tools are **read-only** — nothing signs or sends a transaction. `pumpfun_quote_swap` only quotes; `pumpfun_vanity_mint` returns a keypair for you to use yourself.

| `pumpfun_token_3d`         | **Live 3D snapshot** of a token — composes metadata, holders, and graduation into a shareable [three.ws/coin3d](https://three.ws/coin3d) viewer (spinning coin medallion + holder galaxy + graduation ring) and returns the deep-link, an embeddable iframe, and the underlying data. |

The live tool list is fetched from the backend at startup; a bundled copy ships as an offline fallback so a fresh install always advertises a correct surface.

### Inspect the tools

```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx @three-ws/pumpfun-mcp
```

## Configuration

No configuration is required. One optional override exists:

| Env var           | Default                             | Purpose                                                   |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PUMPFUN_MCP_URL` | `https://three.ws/api/pump-fun-mcp` | Backend endpoint. Override only to self-host the handler. |

## How it works

This package is a small stdio ↔ HTTP bridge. It forwards MCP `tools/call` requests to the canonical three.ws pump.fun JSON-RPC backend, which performs the actual Solana RPC reads and pump.fun API queries. That keeps one authoritative implementation, ships no secrets to clients, and means the tool surface stays current automatically.

`pumpfun_token_3d` is a **native** tool: it runs in-process, orchestrating several backend reads (metadata + bonding curve + holders) and resolving the token logo from its on-chain metadata URI, then returns a deep-link into the three.ws 3D viewer. It needs no extra keys and adds no new backend dependency.

## Requirements

- Node.js **>= 20** (from `engines`).
- No API keys, RPC URL, or wallet. Outbound HTTPS to the three.ws backend (or your `PUMPFUN_MCP_URL`).
